# Japanese-Scope-Ambiguities
(Linguistics, LaTeX) Learn about quantifier scope ambiguities in Japanese and how they compare to English scope ambiguities!

Scope ambiguities are a commonly seen and reviewed problem when covering the semantics of languages like English. The question then arises - what scope ambiguities exist for an entirely different language like Japanese? This paper is aiming to introduce scope ambiguities, analyze different quantifiers in Japanese, and provide details on the differences between some of these quantifiers. First and foremost, a quantifier is defined as a linguistic expression that specify or quantify a set (source). In English, examples of quantifiers include all, every, some, few, and exactly two. Quantifiers indicate the scope of a term, usually a noun or pronoun, to which it is attached to; this inherently brings potential sentence ambiguity to the table. Ambiguity can be considered the presence of two or more meanings in a sentence - the two meanings are represented by two different logical forms (LF), or syntax trees that can be drawn from a single sentence. Because the logical forms have different underlying forms, the syntax trees that can be drawn from each form is different.

Japanese's subject-object-verb (SOV) sentence structure is canonical, meaning that only a subject wide interpretation (deemed as S>O) is available. The noun within the subject of the sentence acts as the entity that actively affects the object with the verb of the sentence. On the other hand, scrambling in Japanese, which involves switching the word order of a sentence without switching its core meaning, produces ambiguous sentences. This ambiguity only takes place when there is an existentially quantified subject and universally quantified object seen in the SOV sentence and scrambled - this is known as a QP-QP sentence.
